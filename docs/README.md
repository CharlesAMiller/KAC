### Why not just use doc.kag2d.com?

The main reason why this was made is so the community can contribute to it. doc.kag2d.com is built when there is an engine update, meaning only THD members with access to engine access to KAG can do it.

Along with that, it only updates per KAG update. This means that if we wanted to fix a spelling mistake, or a minor issue, it would require us to wait for an update.
