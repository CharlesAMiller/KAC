## What is AngelScript
AngelScript, or its other name, AngelCode Scripting Library, is a library aimed to allow programmers to use external scripts with ease. 

Scripting is important for games, and for many other applications, where you may want to edit/rebuild scripts in real time, without having to close the game, recompile it and so on. 

You can find the main site [here](https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/)

## Why does KAG use this over lua?
KAG uses this instead of alternative such as lua because binding functions, scripts and what not was a lot easier to do in angelscript compared to lua for example.
