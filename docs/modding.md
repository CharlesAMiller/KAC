# KAG Modding
In this page, we will talk about how you can mod KAG, what syntax/format you should be following, and how you can set up a local server for testing.

---

## KAG Syntax
KAG's recommended syntax, which can also be found [here](https://github.com/transhumandesign/kag-base/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style)

- Braces go on a new line (poor java devs)
- Indent with tabs (equal to 4 spaces)
- Align with spaces
- void functions AreUpperCase()
- None void functions areLowCase()
- Use s32, u32 instead of int32 (same with other ints)

## Do's and Don'ts
(make sure code is consistant and readable, we would rather it be readable and shit then not readable and good)
(Obfuscate angelscript is useless)
(DRM's should be taken with cautation, open source is prefered)
(Comment code pls)

## Recommended modding format
(mod folders go into ../mods, dont touch base etc)

## Setting up a server (with kag tools)
(simple tutorial on how to set load up a local server)

## Setting up a server (manually)
(same as above)
